### On the Need for Topology-Aware Generative Models for Manifold-Based Defenses
#### Date: 2020-06-25
#### Topic: Adversarial Defenses
[Paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03334)
Several adversarial defenses use a generative model to 'correct' an attack, this can be moderately successful. They go over an interesting concept of level set density, which can be rather powerful. They focus on artifical data, and get good visualizations of their concepts.
