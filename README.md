# Contributing

If you have a paper you want us to discuss, open a PR with a JSON file with the paper name, link, description, and topic. 
You also have to propose a time and add the date you proposed the paper. There are examples in the folders for the respective days. 
Once the paper has been approved (there will be a little discussion on the PR), we'll merge the PR and regenerate the markdown schedules.
